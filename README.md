# **`WHAT I LEARNED IN WEEK 1`**


### **`Human Resource Machine`**

        A coding game that gets difficult in each level. It teaches the arithmetics behind coding. It helps us to have puzzle solving perspective. I think it will be very helpful for us.

### **`HTML`**

`Hyper Text Markup Language`

It was my first time learning about html so it was very exciting to me. HTML is a Standard markup language for creating web pages and web application. Html skeleton is set of tags in order for us to build web pages.. There are head and body sections. Most tags come with pairs like `<p>` and `</p>`, the fist tag is the starting tag. Most end tags have “/“ addition to the starting tag. Another example is `<h1>` and `</h1>` tag. There are many different tags that has different roles in html. We learned about `<h1>` `<h2>` `<h3>` `<ol>` `<ul>` `<li>` `<a href` and `<img src`.

### **`MARKDOWN VS HTM`**


    Starting and ending tags are one of the main difference between markdown and HTML. Since markdown does not have these tags, it makes it easier for us to read. That’s why markdown is very helpful in some cases such as emails,presentations, notes and documents.

     But there are also many things markdown cannot do whereas html can. For example:

* Forms and Input

* Multiple Pages

* Attributes

* Add CSS for layout and style

* Add JavaScript for functionality.

### **`Converting MY Portfolio into HTML`**

    The process was very helpful for me to understand the concepts of html. Since it’s my first experience with html, I had a chance to explore different tags, lists, titles and many more. I struggled mostly with the image tag, but after spending some time, I figured it out. Html was confusing for me at first, but after doing my portfolio.html homework, it started to be fun. I am looking forward to learn more about html!

### **`Flow Charts`**

Flow Charts have 3 different parts: 

* `Action` 
* `Decision`
* `Input/Output`
  
    Fist, we start with a problem. Then we have a decision regarding that problem. It gives us 2 options : Yes or No. Then we have an Action to fix the problem and it goes on in a similar way.
     For example:

  1. My phone is not working. (Problem)
  2. Is the phone charged? (Decision)
  3. Charge the phone (Action)
  4. Working? (Decision)
  5. Yes (Input/Output)

### **`Adventures of Link`**

    This was my favorite project in class. It really helped me to learn more about HTML. I enjoyed being creative and linking different files to each other. I made a mini quiz that has many general knowledge questions. I enjoyed presenting my project and interacting with my classmates. The difficult part about the project is the time management. Trying to finish  the project on time was stressful for me. I want to improve myself on time management.
